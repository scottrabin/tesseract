## Component Specification

*   defcomponent
    *   ADD default-attrs: Returns a map that is merged with attrs at creation
    *   ADD attr-types: Returns a map of attr name to a type of set of types for attr values (similar to prismatic/schema?)
*   Support something like React's `key` attribute to intelligently re-order children
